## Installation

Clone this repository and then execute:

`$ cd single-use-planet-project-api`

Start the backend server with the command:

`$ rails -s`

In another terminal:

`$ cd single-use-planet-project-client`

Start the frontend with the command: 

`$ npm start`

It will ask you if you would like to use a different port because localhost:3000 is already in use (by the backend). Type 'Y' to answer yes.

Then open page in browser according to web address displayed in terminal (ex. https://localhost:3001).

## Usage
Browse and search for common household items to find alternative uses for them and learn how to recycle them so they don't end up in landfills.
